    Use dir() to collect both instance attrs and names inherited from
    its classes. This includes default names inherited from the implied
    'object' superclass above topmost classes. getattr() can fetch
    inherited names not in self.__dict__.
    Caution: use __str__, not __repr__, or else this loops when printing
    bound methods that may be returned for some attributes by getattr().
    This will normally fail for class "slots" attributes not yet assigned.
