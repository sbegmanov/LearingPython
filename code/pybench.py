r"""
Time the speed of one or more Pythons on multiple code-string
benchmarks with timeit. This is a function, to allow timed tests
to vary. It times all code strings in a passed list, in either:
1) The Python running this script, by timeit API calls
2) Multiple Pythons whose paths are passed in a list, by reading
 the output of timeit command lines run by os.popen that use
 Python's -m switch to find timeit on the module search path
In command-line mode (2) only, this replaces all " in timed code
with ', to avoid clashes with argument quoting; splits multiline
statements into one quoted argument per line so all will be run;
and replaces all \t in indentation with 4 spaces for uniformity.
Caveats:
- Command-line mode (only) uses naive quoting and MAY FAIL if code
 embeds and requires double quotes; quoted code is incompatible
 with the host shell; or command length exceeds shell limits.
- PyPy is largely unusable in command-line mode (2) today, as its
 modified timeit output in this mode is jarring in the report.
- This does not (yet?) support a setup statement in any mode: the
 time of all code in the test stmt is charged to its total time.

As fallbacks on fails, use either this module's API-call mode to
test one Python at a time, or the homegrown timer.py module.
