"""
Run pybench.py to time one or more Pythons on multiple code strings.
Use command-line arguments (which appear in sys.argv) to select modes:
<python> pybench_tests.py
 times just the hosting Python on all code listed in stmts below
python3 pybench_tests.py -a
times all stmts in all pythons whose paths are listed below
python3 pybench_tests.py -a -t
 same as -a, but also traces command lines in full
Edit stms below to change tested code, and edit pythons below to give
paths of Python executables to be tested in -a mode. To find a Python's
path, start its REPL, run "import sys", and inspect "sys.executable".
